# SwiftGRPC

A Swift 3.0 binding for [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc), Google's remote procedure call framework.

This is a work in progress. Currently, the only functionality available is the client API for an insecure unary blocking call.

## CGRPC

This module relies on [CGRPC](https://github.com/Huawei-PTLab/CGRPC/) which is a wrapper for the C core library in gRPC. See its README for installation instructions.
